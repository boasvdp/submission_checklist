# Last checks before submitting any manuscript

Everything I've done wrong when submitting or resubmitting a manuscript in a convenient checklist. The tidier your submission is, the higher your chance of having it accepted.

## First submission and resubmission

- [ ] Are all tables/figured (including supplementary!) referenced in the text?
- [ ] Does the order of figures, tables, supplementary tables follow the order they're mentioned in the text?
- [ ] Are the tables in your Supplementary Tables file in the right order, i.e., does Table S2 still follow Table S1?
- [ ] If you have any paper-wide set orders of things (like species B, species C, species D), are they consistent in the text, tables, figures?
- [ ] Are all special words consistently spelled? for example, does the text switch from 'AA-genome' to 'A-genome', or from 'A-genome' to 'A genome'?
- [ ] Is the paper-title in the coverletter still the same as in the manuscript?
- [ ] Is there any leftover placeholder text like (CITATION), doi://XYZ, Table X, [TODO]? 
- [ ] Have you forgotten a co-author?
- [ ] Is everyone's name spelled as in their other papers? What about their affiliations?
- [ ] Reread the journal's formatting rules - are you really following them? Are you sure about the order of your sections, and that you have all sections?
- [ ] Are your references in the right format? Do you have in-text references not in your References block? Do you have preprints that are now published? Are species names in italics? 
- [ ] Do you have duplicated references? (You can have Person 2016a and Person 2016b, but they're just two slightly differently spelled entries in your library)
- [ ] Are species names in your text/figures/tables in italics?
- [ ] Is your coloring scheme consistent across figures, where applicable? Did you take colourblindness into account?
- [ ] Are the Supplementary Tables pretty enough, numbers correctly formatted, table headers detailed enough?
- [ ] In the acknowledgments, are all grants acknowledged with correct IDs? Are students' scholarships acknowledged? Are your institutions (HPC!) acknowledged?
- [ ] Have you run the spellchecker manually one last time?
- [ ] Have you uploaded all files the text references, including the cover letter?
- [ ] Have you uploaded sequencing data and associated metadata to repositories? Has the embargo been lifted?
- [ ] Have you archived the associated code on Zenodo and assigned a DOI?
- [ ] Have you clicked the submit button?

## Resubmission
- [ ] When resubmitting, have all co-authors had enough time to comment on the revised manuscript? Have you given them a deadline?
- [ ] Reread the reviewers' comments - have you missed any in your response?
- [ ] Have any tables/figures/supplementary table numbers changed, and are these correctly referenced in the text? Is (Table 2) in the text still (Table 2), or should it be (Table 4) now?
- [ ] If you were the reviewer, would you feel like your concerns were sufficiently addressed?
